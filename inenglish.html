            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>Hi and welcome to my page! <br><br>My name is Lauramaria Heiskanen and I’m a first year student of business information technology. This website here is something that I’ve designed and created on my own, guided by the very soft touch of the world wide web. I’ve studied HTML and CSS by myself only using the tools that are found on internet. It has been challenging but most definetely it has been rewarding. I have  lot to do, more languages to learn but this ongoing project is a good start and a great introduction to coding.</p>
            <p>To answer my own question of who am I, we should go back to my roots. I was born and raised in Finnish Lapland and that is probably why I’m in love with winter, the best season of all them. When I was 19, life forced me to move from Lapland to Southern Finland, Helsinki. I’ve lived here now more than 10 years and even though I’m enjoying the atmosphere of  big city (in Finnish scale..), I miss Lapland. When the time is right, I will move back. </p>
            <p>If I had to describe me in one word, it would be team player. I learned these skills while playing this winter sports called bandy. I was part of few different teams in Finland and in Sweden and I had the honor to be one of the few, who had the chance to play for my country in world championchip games. I have couple of silver and bronze medals from these wcc tournaments, so I’d say my teams did well back in the day. Later on I focused more in work and other walks of life which meant that I had less time for sports.  </p>
            <p>Nowadays I enjoy a good video game, sauna, walking outside and good music. I even play some piano and guitar and I also sing from time to time. Few years back I got into pc building and in the world related to that. Such an interesting topic, I could talk about it for hours! I could say that when I started playing video games, a sparkle for this industry was ignited. </p>
            <p>I hope you enjoyed the visit here in my website. However, if you were left with questions, do not hesitate to contact me via email.  </p>
